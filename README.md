# The TruEnd-procedure: Treating trailing zero-valued balances in credit data
 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/695033824.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10908342)

A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of trailing zero (or very small) month-end balances. Identifying these trailing balances requires an exact definition of a "small balance", which our method informs.  We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using South African residential mortgages. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model, e.g., survival analysis. Having discarded these excess histories, we demonstrably improve the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under IFRS 9. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.

## Structure
This R-codebase can be run sequentially using the file numbering itself as a structure. **Delinquency measures** are algorithmically defined in **DelinqM.R** as data-driven functions, which may be valuable to the practitioner outside of the study's current scope. These delinquency measures were formulated and empirically tested in [Botha22](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358329458_The_loss_optimization_of_loan_recovery_decision_times_using_forecast_cashflows), as part of a loss optimisation exercise of recovery decision times, as implemented in the corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/The-loss-optimisation-of-loan-recovery-decision-times-using-forecast-cash-flows). A simulation study from [Botha2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350169758_Simulation-based_optimisation_of_the_timing_of_loan_recovery_across_different_portfolios) also demonstrated these delinquency measures at length, with its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/Simulation-based-optimisation-of-the-timing-of-loan-recovery-across-different-portfolios). Similarly, the **TruEnd-procedure** from [Botha2024](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380214432_The_TruEnd-procedure_Treating_trailing_zero-valued_balances_in_credit_data) and its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/TruEnd-Procedure)  is implemented in the **TruEnd.R** script, which includes a small variety of functions related to running the TruEnd-procedure practically.

## Data
This R-codebase assumes that monthly loan performance data is available. Naturally, the data itself can't be made publically available given its sensitive nature, as well as various data privacy laws, particularly the _Protection of Personal Information (POPI)_ Act of 2013 in South Africa. However, the structure and type of data that is required for reproducing this study, is sufficiently described in the commentary within the scripts. This should enable the practitioner to extract and prepare data accordingly. Moreover, this codebase assumes South African macroeconomic data is available, as sourced and collated by internal staff of the bank in question.
